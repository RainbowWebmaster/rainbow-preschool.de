      <h2>Welcome to Rainbow Preschool</h2>
      <p>Rainbow Preschool in Munich is a bilingual Montessori Preschool for children of ages 3 to 6, supported by the City of Munich. We have promoted and celebrated multicultural coexistence since 2000. "The world is a rainbow with many kinds of people" – this singular line of a children's song is the embodiment of what the children, <a href="our-teachers">teachers</a>, and parents experience here at Rainbow Preschool.</p>
      <p>Rainbow Preschool's educational concept relies on the teaching methods of the Italian reform educator and physician, <a href="about-montessori">Maria Montessori</a>. Within the caring environment of Rainbow Preschool, the children can be curious, take initiative, discover independence and the joy of learning.</p>
